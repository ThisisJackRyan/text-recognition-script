# Text to 3D Frame Generator

The idea for this is that if I upload a picture of a handwritten or typed letter this script would identify the text and create a 3d model with the text raised a few millimeters on a flat base.
Creating a sort of picture frame ready to be sliced and 3d printed.

#### The flowing text was generated by Cursor agent lol.

This Python application converts text from images (both handwritten and typed) into 3D printable frames. The text is extracted using OCR and then converted into a raised 3D model within a picture frame.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Tesseract OCR engine
3. OpenSCAD (for viewing and exporting the 3D models)

### Installing Tesseract OCR

#### macOS
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

#### Windows
Download and install from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
#### windows 
```bash
python text_to_3d_frame.py
```

#### macOS 
```bash
python3 text_to_3d_frame.py
```

2. When prompted, enter:
   - The path to your input image
   - The desired output path for the SCAD file

3. The script will:
   - Process the image and extract text
   - Create a 3D model with raised text
   - Save the model as a SCAD file

4. Open the generated SCAD file in OpenSCAD to:
   - Preview the 3D model
   - Export to STL format for 3D printing

## Features

- Supports both handwritten and typed text
- Creates a customizable picture frame
- Raises the extracted text for 3D printing
- Preserves text positioning and style
- Adjustable frame dimensions and text height

## Notes

- For best results, use clear, well-lit images
- Text should be clearly visible against the background
- The frame dimensions can be adjusted in the code (default: 200x200x10mm)
